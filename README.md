# portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Daniel :)

## To be able to use the python script with yaml:
`pip install pyyaml`
`python generate_projects.py`
This will generate .md files for each project in project-pages.yml, and save backups of each .md file in _project-page-backups before they are overwritten


## To clear and run the jekyll local server:
`bundle exec jekyll clean`
`bundle exec jekyll serve`

## To run the generate-projects python script AND serve the jekyll local server:
`rake serve`
