  development_process:
    overview: >
      Developing Ticketer as a solo project was an exhilarating journey that pushed me to expand my technical expertise and problem-solving skills. Tackling unfamiliar technologies such as Angular, C#, ASP.NET Core, Azure, and Docker presented numerous challenges, each serving as a valuable learning opportunity. Building this comprehensive application from the ground up not only deepened my understanding of full-stack development but also reinforced the importance of meticulous planning and adaptability in overcoming obstacles.

    steps:
      - title: 'Strategic Planning and MVP Definition'
        description: >
          The foundation of Ticketer was laid by meticulously planning out the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). I identified and prioritized key functionalities essential for a robust task management tool, ensuring that each feature aligned with user needs and project goals. This phase involved designing the API architecture, defining database schemas with clear primary keys and relationships, and outlining the core interactions between the frontend and backend. This strategic approach was crucial in setting a clear roadmap and establishing a solid base for Ticketer.

        caption : 'Screenshot of Ticketer MVP outline document' 

      - title: 'UI/UX Design and API Refinement'
        description: >
          With the MVP outlined, I transitioned to designing the user interface using Figma, keeping the planned APIs in mind. This alignment between UI/UX design and backend development allowed for a more cohesive and intuitive user experience. Detailed wireframes and prototypes provided a clear vision of user interactions, which in turn informed the refinement of API routes, parameters, and data models. This iterative process ensured that the APIs were not only functional but also optimized for seamless integration with the frontend, enhancing overall application efficiency.

      - title: 'Optimizing Data Structures for Positioning Systems'
        description: >
          One of the most intricate challenges was managing the dynamic positioning of lists and tickets within the Kanban board. Ensuring that moving a list or ticket seamlessly updated the positions of surrounding items required a robust data structure. I engineered a system where each list and ticket maintained a unique position index, enabling real-time updates and maintaining data integrity. Implementing this with ASP.NET Core and MySQL involved strategies to handle reordering logic efficiently, ensuring smooth and consistent user interactions without compromising performance.

      - title: 'Developing a Scalable Menu and Submenu System'
        description: >
          The heart of Ticketer''s user interactions lies in its versatile menu and submenu system. To achieve a clean and reusable solution, I designed a dynamic configuration-based system that dictates the behavior and structure of all menus across the app. By creating a flexible data structure that the menu components could interpret, I eliminated repetitive code and facilitated easy scalability. This approach allowed for effortless addition of new menu items and submenus, ensuring consistency across the application and significantly reducing development time for future enhancements.

      - title: 'Cloud Deployment with Azure and Docker'
        description: >
          Deploying Ticketer on Azure using Docker containers presented a unique set of challenges, particularly in configuring the virtual machines and ensuring secure communications through SSL certificates. I navigated the complexities of Azure's ecosystem by setting up automated deployment scripts, managing container orchestration, and configuring domain settings to establish a reliable and secure production environment. This hands-on experience with cloud services not only optimized the application's scalability and reliability but also showcased my ability to manage end-to-end deployment processes effectively.

      - title: 'Outcomes and Reflections'
        description: >
          Ticketer stands as an example of my ability to independently manage and deliver a complex full-stack application. Successfully integrating Angular with a C# and ASP.NET Core backend, and deploying it on Azure with Docker, has significantly broadened my technical repertoire. The project not only operates seamlessly but also embodies best practices in software development, from efficient data structures to scalable deployment strategies. Reflecting on this journey, I recognize the importance of detailed planning, continuous learning, and adaptability in overcoming challenges, all of which have been instrumental in shaping me into a more proficient and resilient developer.

    lessons_learned: 
      - >
        Throughout the development of Ticketer, one of the most pivotal lessons I learned was the importance of implementing comprehensive testing from the outset. Initially, I underestimated the value of automated tests, believing they might slow down development speed. I had written tests before in earlier projects, with Jest and Vite, but I took them for granted. Because, as Ticketer grew, I encountered multiple scenarios where the absence of tests led to elusive bugs and hindered efficient debugging. 
      - >
        This experience taught me the hard way that a robust testing suite is indispensable for maintaining code quality and reliability, especially in complex applications. Additionally, I gained invaluable insights into effective project management and time allocation, realizing that balancing feature development with thorough testing and documentation is essential for long-term project success.
      - >
        Another significant lesson was the power of leveraging cloud services effectively. Navigating Azure's vast array of tools and services taught me how to optimize resource allocation, enhance application scalability, and ensure robust security measures. Managing Docker containers not only streamlined the deployment process but also reinforced the importance of automation in modern software development. These experiences have equipped me with the skills to architect scalable, secure, and efficient applications, making me a more versatile and capable developer.
