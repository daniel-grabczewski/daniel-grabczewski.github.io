    description:
      "Bnanas is an e-commerce app that sells exotic bananas. We created this app because we wanted to learn how e-commerce works and get practical experience. While working on this project, we faced some challenges and learned a lot. One thing I realized is that we needed to communicate and work more efficiently as a team. If we had clearer roles and knew who was responsible for what, it would have made things go smoother. Overall, I am very happy with how this project turned out and I'm excited for you to check it out!",

      'Paint My Museic is an exciting web app that blends the joy of painting with the magic of music. My motivation behind this project was to explore the fusion of colors and melodies, creating a unique artistic experience; while painting with each color, a song will play specific to that color! Throughout our journey, I encountered challenges that helped me grow. One valuable lesson I learned was the importance of optimizing performance to ensure smooth interaction between painting and music.',
